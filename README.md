Things to do:
 - create the data structure
 - create manager for data structure
      - create a parser
      - create a method that gets the milk weight total
      - create a method that gets the milk weight percentage
 - create the main class that displays data struture
      - create and finish add data
      - create and finish read data
      - create and finish generate report
      - create a file output of the data


Bug reports:
 - items in annual report, monthly report, and Date-Range report are not sorted
 - For "display" button, if display button is hit and then back is hit and then display button is it again, when you hit back again in the display button window, you have to hit back to times to go back to the primary window. For some reason a null table is displayed the first time you hit back and then goes away after you hit back again.
 
 Future Additions:
 - Sort all the data by weights and give the user the option of picking ascending or descending
 - Fix minor bug with display button windows, back button
 - Add bar-charts/histograms to generate report button, rather than just a raw table
 - Add more meaningful error messages depending on what the user inputted incorrectly
 - improve generally on condesing our code and speeding up our processing, by maybe implementing a faster data-structure and more time-effecient code.
